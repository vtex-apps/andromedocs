# Contributing

## Development guidelines

In this project, we follow the [VTEX Dev Guidelines](https://github.com/vtex/dev-guidelines/). Please, take a minute to become familiar with them so that we can keep our code clean and easy to understand, which is our top priority.

## Opening issues

Noticed something missing or found a bug while using the project? We have a few issue templates: there is one for [bug reports](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/BUG_REPORT.md), another for [feature requests](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/FEATURE_REQUEST.md), and, finally, a specific template for [new component proposals](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/NEW_COMPONENT.md).

## Creating pull requests

We have a [PR template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) with some indications of how it should be filled. We also encourage you to add a GIF that best describes how you feel at the moment of the PR submission âœ¨

If you come across any open issues that you'd like to help us with, feel free to comment. Once you've been assigned, you can start working on it, and we're always available to help if you need it, so don't be shy!
